title: "Vatlongos website"

This website is for resources about Vatlongos language, spoken in Southeast Ambrym, Vanuatu.

This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

I've also used [babelquarto](https://docs.ropensci.org/babelquarto/) to create a multilingual website (in English and Bislama).
