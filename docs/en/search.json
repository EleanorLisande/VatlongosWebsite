Every langauge has rules about the sound of the language (or gestures in sign languages), rules about how words are made up, and rules about how to make sentences.\nOn the side bar you can choose different chapters that cover different different areas of the Vatlongos language. At the moment there is a section about sounds and spelling, but I’ll continue to update more chapters.",
