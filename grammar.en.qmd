title: "Grammar"
---

This section is a like a book that linguists call a ‘Grammar’. Grammars try to give lots of information about the rules of a particular language. Every language has rules about the sound of the language (or gestures in sign languages), rules about how words are made up, and rules about how to make sentences.

On the side bar you can choose different chapters that cover different different areas of the Vatlongos language. At the moment there is a section about sounds and spelling, but I’ll continue to update more chapters.
